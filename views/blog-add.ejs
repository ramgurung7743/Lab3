    <h1>My Final Year:</h1>
    <p>After graduating from high school in 2008, I embarked on various endeavors. 
        However, in 2019, I made the decision to return to school with a newfound 
        determination to earn a degree. Now, in the final year of my undergraduate studies, 
        I am pursuing a major in Computer Science, driven by a genuine desire to achieve my academic goals.
